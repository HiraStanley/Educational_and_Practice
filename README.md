# Learning Data Science: Python, R, SQL, Linear Algebra, and Machine Learning

Welcome to my **learning playground!**  
This repository is a collection of projects, exercises, and experiments as I explored the fundamentals of **Python, R, SQL, linear algebra, data manipulation, and basic machine learning.**

Itâ€™s intentionally **messy**â€”this is where I practiced, made mistakes, and iterated as I built core skills.

## ðŸ“‚ What's in This Repository

This repo is a mixed bag of:
- âœ… Python scripting exercises  
- âœ… R scripts and visualizations  
- âœ… SQL queries and database practice  
- âœ… Linear algebra walkthroughs and notes  
- âœ… Pandas data wrangling experiments  
- âœ… Basic machine learning models (regression, classification)

## ðŸš§ Notes

- This is **not a polished portfolio.**
- Files may not be fully documented.
- Folder and file names may vary as I explored topics freely.

## ðŸ“š Purpose

This repository serves as a **record of my learning journey** from 2022. Itâ€™s a sandbox where I tried out different tools, libraries, and techniques to develop a foundational skill set in data science and analytics. A lot of it was assignments and practice related to Udemy and Coursera courses prior to starting my Master's degree at University of Chicago.
